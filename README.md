# Ecommerce-horzions-45



**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other of your choice.

### Step 1: Create a React App

1. Open your terminal (command prompt, PowerShell, or terminal emulator of your choice).

2. Create a new React app using `create-react-app`. 
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app ecommerce-app
    ```

    This command will set up a new React project with all the necessary files and dependencies.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-app
    ```

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

1. To run your React app locally, you can use the development server provided by `create-react-app`. In the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the development server, and your React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Your default web browser should open and display your React app.

    Any changes you make to your React code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

### Step 4: Edit Your React App

1. Open your code editor and navigate to the `src` directory within your project folder. This is where your React application code is located.

2. You can start editing your React components by modifying the files in the `src` directory. As you make changes, the development server will automatically update the app in your browser.

### Step 5: Stop the Development Server

1. To stop the development server, go to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl + C`.

### Additional Information:

- You can install additional npm packages for your project using the `npm install` command.

- To build a production-ready version of your app, you can run `npm run build`. This will create an optimized version of your app in the `build` directory.

- You can customize the development server's settings and behavior by modifying the `package.json` file in your project's root directory.

- Remember to save your code changes. React will hot-reload the app in the browser when you save your files.

That's it! You now have a React.js application named "ecommerce-app" running locally on your machine. You can continue to develop and customize your ecommerce app from here.
